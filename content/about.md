Hello! everyone. I am Devansh Maurya. Currently, I am pursuing Bachelor of Technology at National Institute of Technology Meghalaya. My branch is Computer Science and Engineering. This being my first blog ever, I will like to introduce myself to you.


Originally, I am from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. From my childhood, I had a keen interest in physics and astronomy. I always dreamt of working in the field of astronomy. I always thought of pursuing an undergraduate course in physics after completing my school. But life doesnâ€™t always go as planned. In my last year at school, I filled up the Joint Entrance Exam(Mains) form, just to give it a shot, as it is considered as a very reputed exam in India. The exam is a single door entry to various NITs, IIITs and GFTIs of the country. The exam also serves as a qualifying exam for appearing for JEE(Advanced), qualifying which, people get into the Indian Institute of Technology(IITs). After clearing the JEE(Mains), I got admission in NIT Meghalaya.

Here, I met with some very wonderful people from all across India. The company of the students here was awesome. In this one year, that I spent at this college, I got to know a lot about technical stuff. I never wrote code in any kind of programming language before in my life. My first experience with C programming language happened when I was in my second semester. Getting to know the logic behind the working of computers was really amazing. Earlier I was afraid that how will I manage to compete with the other people in the class, most of which are already having a good experience in programming from their school days. But as itâ€™s said, â€œHard work is the key to successâ€œ, my time spent on learning C language proved fruitful, as I passed the semester with the best grades.

Coming to the blog. What would it be about?

Well, I like to experience with my gadgets. More often than not I try to modify the software in them. Sometimes it results in discovering something really good, and sometimes just something messed up. So then I look for the solutions of my problems over the net and of the time end up getting rid of them. But the things that really troubles me is not keeping a record of all those troubleshooting. Often it happens that I run in the same or similar kind of problem again and I find myself searching the whole internet for the solution.  So I thought writing a blog about how I got rid of all those issues will help not only me by keeping a record, but also all those people who ran into a similar kind of problem and not able to find a solution. Be it discovering, creating or learning something new, or solving a problem, I will try to write about everything here.

So, if you are one of those people who keep on experimenting with your tech, be sure to check the posts on this blog regularly. Who knows you may end up getting a solution for the exact problem that you are looking for!

**See you soon with a new post. ðŸ™‚**
