        <p>It&rsquo;s been two months of me being a part of the software engineers' tribe in the IT jungle, as an Android engineer in an ed-tech startup. Because of the ongoing pandemic, I am working from home like a lot of other tribe members. I never expected my first job to start remotely. I was very excited to start my carrier as a software developer, especially because it would have been an opportunity to move to a new city and explore places‚Ää-‚Äätravelling soul I tell you ‚òπÔ∏è‚Ää-‚Ääbut that didn&rsquo;t happen because of the pandemic.
I have made some observations about the differences in professional life (remote üò¢) and college life; about working at a startup and working remotely (üò∂). This will be my first article on medium, and as it is said, it takes the greatest amount of effort to start something, so let me overcome the inertia and share my observations with all of you. Let&rsquo;s begin:</p>
<h2 id="oh-dear-college">Oh, Dear College!¬†üéì</h2>
<p>As a legend said‚Ää-‚ÄäPart of the journey is the end. The cover picture states it very nicely. You&rsquo;ll have to leave a road well built for you and move on a path where you&rsquo;ll have to find your way which will shape your career, life and you as a person overall. All those days when we do not need to care about many things, don&rsquo;t have to answerable to anyone (teachers? NO), are very much replaced by days of becoming more responsible and, professional. So here are my some observations and tips regarding this:</p>
<ul>
<li>After getting a job, your college doesn&rsquo;t matter much. Also your CV. The only thing that matters is how much knowledge you possess and are you able to make valid and rational decisions at the moment ü§ì.</li>
<li>Find a mentor. A go-to person with whom you can discuss your work-related issues and try to learn more about the company. Better if he/she is someone working in your domain, as then you can ask him/her for any help and direction and get to learn new things every day.</li>
<li>Keep on learning üìö. A very important point. Just because you are out of college, doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t need to study. Keep on improving your knowledge by reading about the area in which you are working. Learn new tools and technologies. And from time to time, keep on revising the subjects you learnt in college, especially your CS fundamentals.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll have access to a lot of new tools, technologies and resources. Try to make the most use of it for the growth of yourself and your organisation.</li>
<li>You are answerable to your manager and senior developer for tasks assigned to you.</li>
<li>You need to manage your time wisely ‚è±Ô∏è and you can&rsquo;t keep on delaying a task or keep on asking more time. Well, no one will force you to finish something if you are finding it hard, but if you are not learning and just keep on wasting time, it&rsquo;s bad for you and also for your company.</li>
<li>Remember those behavioural interviews. Well, now I understand how important they are in a professional environment. Time and again you will find yourself in situations where you will disagree with your manager, designer or other teammates on certain aspects of the product. That time, your behaviour in taking a discussion forward without losing your temper is tested. So, the takeaway is to be calm, always ready to listen and positively put your points üßò.</li>
<li>We all have copied assignments in college, so we know how it feels when our submission depends on someone else completing his/her work on time üòâ. That is what we call having a dependency on someone else. Try not to make someone dependent on you to wait for too long. If there are some issues, inform them in time so that they can manage their schedule accordingly.</li>
<li>Give some rest to your eyes ü•∫. As a software developer, most of your day will go working in front of a screen. So, manage your screen time. You can&rsquo;t just start using a mobile phone in the name of taking a break. You need some time away from the screen. In that time, you can simply lie down with eyes closed or read something written on a real paper üìñ¬†, yes such things still exist.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="start-up-">Start-up! üöÄ</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome to the chaos!&rdquo; were the words I was told during my onboarding session. Working at a startup has some contrasting differences from working at MNCs. Especially the days shown in most of those &ldquo;A Day in a life of a Software Engineer&rdquo; videos won&rsquo;t be yours. Because startups mostly work with a small time and have a very fast-paced worked, it&rsquo;s a different life altogether. Some observations on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to a more open culture üëê. Everyone from a team is treated equally. Whether you are a new grad or a professional with years of experience, you both get an equal chance to raise your point. No calling each other as &ldquo;sir&rdquo;, as we did in college. People treat each other as friends despite the age and experience gaps. This is your time to make some really good connections and learn from them.</li>
<li>Be proactive ‚è©. Always be ready to take up new and challenging tasks. In this way, you&rsquo;ll be able to learn the most and will enjoy your work. Startups don&rsquo;t have much time to train a new hire into a technology. So, they need people who are quick learners and believe in &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Be ready to stretch your working hours. Sometimes, you may have to work outside your woking hours, sometimes to finish a task in time or sometimes because of some other employee who happens to have different working time. I have had days where I had to be awake till 2 or 3 in the night to complete a task for a release.</li>
<li>No hierarchies. This is by far one of the biggest advantages of working at a startup. There are little to no hierarchies. You can talk directly to the manager, designer, tester, other devs‚Ää-‚Ääanyone. Where will you get a chance to discuss something directly with the CTO or co-founders!</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll find that people are passionate about what they are building and are very closely related to the product. From day 1, you&rsquo;ll get to work on the real product and contribute to it directly. Trust me, the joy you&rsquo;ll feel when the code that you wrote runs in production is amazing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="but-you-said-you-have-an-office-now">But you said you have an office now¬†?!¬†üë®‚Äçüíª</h2>
<p>Many relatives ask me this question &ldquo;What are you doing sitting all day long? And someone is paying you for this!&rdquo;. Well, that&rsquo;s what remote work is, really hard to explain to some people. Almost all the people in the IT industry are now working remotely. Going remote was especially easy for startups as they had all the infrastructure already setup up, which everyone is realising now. Here are my some observations on remote work-</p>
<ul>
<li>By starting a professional career working from home, we are saving a lot of expenses. No cost of commuting, no rent of room or managing food on own, no formals or thinking about dressing properly. So, a lot of savings, both in terms of money and time! üí∞</li>
<li>You get delicious homemade food ü•ò¬†. You can save time spent on preparing a meal (or save money on buying food, if you don&rsquo;t know how to cook ü§∑Ô∏è). Also, you can enjoy a variety of dishes prepared at home!</li>
<li>You get to spend more time with your parents üë™. The last time I stayed for around two months at my home was in summer 2018! Long time. Because of remote working, I am at home for 5 months now, and as it appears, maybe it will be like this till the end of this year. So, this is a great time to spend with your parents, sharing your stories of college life, trips with them, and learning about their experiences.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t lose focus. As you are at home, you can have all sort of distractions, small kids, friends, other family members who may not realise you are doing some real work on the computer. At that time, it becomes your responsibility to let them know that you are busy and need to do your work with focus.</li>
<li>Get off of that chair üí∫. You may spend your whole day sitting in one place while working. That can be very bad for your fitness. I have gained a lot of weight during the lockdown ‚òπÔ∏è¬†. So, keep on doing a small number of physical works at regular intervals and try exercising in the morning, although I too need to need to work on this üòÖ.</li>
<li>Manage your time. Just because you are at home doesn&rsquo;t mean you can work at any time. Try having a schedule and fixed working hours. Otherwise, most often, you&rsquo;ll end up working more than the daily hours.</li>
<li>Hold your wanderlust! The time to travel will come again üòä.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope my observations and tips were helpful to you. I am still just starting in this area trying to figure out things while making discoveries every day. It&rsquo;s like someone has opened a gate to a new world and it is up to you how much you can explore. As I can&rsquo;t travel and explore outside because of the pandemic, thanks to remote working, at least I can explore this jungle from the comfort of my home. If you are reading this, thanks for coming till the end. And if you liked this, please give some claps üëè¬†.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stay home, stay safe!</em></strong> üò∑</p>
